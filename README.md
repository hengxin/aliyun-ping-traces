# aliyun-ping-traces
Week-long ping logs across 9 Aliyun (阿里云) ECSes, spanning 3 datacenters in North China, South China, and East China.

For the raw data, please refer to [Hengfeng Wei/aliyun-ping-traces](https://bitbucket.org/hengxin/aliyun-ping-traces) at Bitbucket. I failed to upload it to this project in GitHub via GLF (Git Large Files).
